# Breast Cancer Classification with KNN and Decision Trees

### Objective
Predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using supervised machine learning.

### Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from Kaggle.

### Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

### Key Findings
- KNN achieved higher accuracy after feature scaling.
- Decision Tree provided interpretability with slightly lower performance.
- Demonstrates the tradeoff between explainability and predictive power.

### Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
